** Detect Cyberbullying based on Naive Bayes and Data Mining  **

** Project Description **
This project use naive bayes model to train dataset and  detect cyberbullying.
Our project aims to detect cyberbullying by using machine learning models and social network mining processes. 
The implementation components include web scraping, data collection, and data pre-processing. 
We have then used naive bayes classification model to extract the key information and analyze the sentiment.
This data is then used to decide whether the message is cyberbullying or not.
